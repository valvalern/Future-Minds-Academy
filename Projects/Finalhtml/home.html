                <p>My name is Valerian Arifi and im a web development cuurently studying css at futureminds academy. I
                    have learned html in the past too but I went on and off and never really took it seriously until I
                    began studying here and so far the experience has been great and im having fun learning and im
                    excited to learn new things amd hopefully in the future build my own functional and proffesional
                    webpages or maybe ill delve into software development like apps, games etc. When im not deciding
                    whether to put the article inside the section or the section tag inside the article I like to watch
                    movies/series, listen to music, go on walks, bicycle rides, reading, soemtimes drawing, hanging out
                    with friends/family etc. Im also soemwhat of a mathlete which basically means math athlete being a
                    double time 1st place winner of the gjilan mathematical olympiad so yeah im decent at math which is
                    probably gonna help with programming. My goal right now is to learn and perfect web development and
                    write webpages with ease and im determied to do just that!</p>
